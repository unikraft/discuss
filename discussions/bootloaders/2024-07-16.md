## :dart: Agenda

- Status update
- Next steps

## :closed_book: Discussions

### Lxboot

MF: I didn't get to work on the Lxboot part.
I was busy with a summer school, but that's done.
I will resume today.

### GSoC

SM: Mihnea, please check my feedback on your blog PR.

SJ: I will look into upstreaming the remaining GSoC blog PRs.

### Other Items

RD: Michalis did updates to the initialization process, to facilitate the integration of CCA.

RD: Rareș will work on bhyve support (FreeBSD hypervisor) for Unikraft.
However, integrating it (similar to HyperV, VMware and RISC-V support) will require the completion of the plat re-arch track.
That track will take longer given current focus in the company.

## :wrench: TODOs and Decisions

MF: Update GSoC blog post according to feedback from Sergiu: https://github.com/unikraft/docs/pull/440

MF: Follow Sergiu's instructions on the GSoC project (Lxboot) updates.

SJ: Integrate PRs from Mihnea and Yang Hu.

RD: Announce 2nd GSoC blog posts.
