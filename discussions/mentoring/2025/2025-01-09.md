- Multiboot2 status (MariaP)
- Catalog, Zig status (MihneaF)
- Driver shim kick-off (MihneaF)
- LXboot status (MihneaF)
- Xen PVH (AndreiS)
- Xen setup at UPB (AndreiS)
- Xen ARM64 + filesystem issue (AndreiS)

## Discussions

MF: Focus on Dart.
Pick up LXboot sometime later.

AS: helloworld works with Xen PVH, but there is still work to be done.

AS: On the bit compat side, from my understanding, we need to build `app-elfloader` as a PIE application.

AS: R-Pi5 needs updated work.
R-Pi4 works with a specific setup.
When I asked on Elements / Matrix on Xen on R-Pi, I got the same reply pointing to the links for R-Pi4.
U-Boot works for R-Pi4, but not for R-Pi5 so I need to update it.

## TODOs and Decisions

MF: Work on getting Dart ready.

RD: Prepare the baremetal / driver shim track for Mihnea.

AS: Focus on Xen PVH.
