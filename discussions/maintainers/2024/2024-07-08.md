## :closed_book: Discussions

### HW Randomization Issue

RD: There is a trade-off between usability and security.

MP: One option would be to disable hardware randomization when not required.

MP: This should reduce the noise a lot.

RD: Can we build a statically-build version of QEMU?

MP: I looked into this lately, and the best way is to rely on host provided randomness.
This would be facilitated by KraftKit.

### PR-granular Bisect Tool

SK: If you do changes to the commit and you do that wisely, you wouldn't run into this.

SK: I would encourage to do commits that don't break things.

### Branch Names and Merge Model

We are using different branch names for different repositories:

- `main` or `staging` as the default branch
- `Rebase-and-merge` vs just `Merge` as PR merging strategy.

### Library Tagging

We tag libraries with new release tags only if they being updated part of the release.

### Atomic Macros

We will leave the [atomic macros PR](https://github.com/unikraft/unikraft/pull/645) for later.

### Release 0.18

Postpone it for September-October 2024.

## :wrench: TODOs and Decisions

We tag libraries based on their updates.
If a library is updated for the release, a tag will be added to it.
Otherwise no.

RD: Schedule next release for September-October 2024.

RD: Document repositories and branch names and merge model.

RD: Take care of [catalog test PRs](https://discord.com/channels/762976922531528725/857555406187528212/1228342956289818624) (from Cezar)
