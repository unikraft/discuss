## :closed_book: Discussions

### Current Build / Run Issues

MP: We need to pass to KraftKit 32bit words.

MP: We require 10 32bit words: 8 for the key and 2 for nonce.

MP: In Xen we can use the chosen rng seed used by Linux.
This is used compared to the command line.

MP: Linux passes only the numbers and not the nonce.

MP: We might reduce the requirements from 10 to 8.

If the syscall shim is not enabled, it will appear as if you never called this function.

I can make the syscalls configurable, so that the syscall shim is enabled.

### Release Items

MP: I have items on an ARM64 security sides of things.

MP/RD: We'll see if these make it to the current release or the next on.

## :wrench: TODOs and Decisions

AJ / CC: Work on providing the randomness support in KraftKit.

MP: https://github.com/unikraft/unikraft/pull/1114, together with print items

SJ: Update documentation with coding / documentation guidelines for using ASCII and one line documentation Markdown.
