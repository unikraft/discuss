## :closed_book: Discussions

### Current and Next Release

There are still several items part of the [`Release - Next` release](https://github.com/orgs/unikraft/projects/47/views/2) to be handled.
Apart from small fixes, there are 5 more items:
- Simon needs to review [PR `942`](https://github.com/unikraft/unikraft/pull/942) on `ukfalloc` exports via `ukstore`.
- Simon needs to review [PR `1477`](https://github.com/unikraft/unikraft/pull/1477) on `uksched` exports via `ukstore`.
- Simon needs to review [PR `1496`](https://github.com/unikraft/unikraft/pull/1496) for CPU-generated randomness from MIchalis.
- Simon needs to update [PR `1501`](https://github.com/unikraft/unikraft/pull/1501) on serial driver configuration, based on reviews from Michalis and Oleksii.
- Sergiu needs to update [PR `1315`](https://github.com/unikraft/unikraft/pull/1315) on using function pointers for ECTX ops.

With these in, we will make the release.

The minor items are being taken care of, with different reviewers and assignees working on them.

For [PR `804`](https://github.com/unikraft/unikraft/pull/804), Andrei Stan is making updates.
Michalis is the assignee.

Good news: Once a PR is closed, the corresponding issue is closed.
Cezar updated the `governctl` command to do that.
It didn't work in the past, because we use a different merging model, with an intermediary branch.

The release will probably happen early next week (October 21-25, 2024).

### Catalogs

There is a [`catalog-core` repository](https://github.com/unikraft/catalog-core) that is meant to be used by maintainers, developers, reviewers and testers.
It has no connection to KraftKit and `Kraftfile`s.

The `main` branch gets you to use the default `make menuconfig` + `make` commands.
The `scripts` branch allows scripted runs.
The `test` branch automates testing.

This should be the best way to have maintainer, developers, reviewers and testers do their work.

### Others

The next release (0.19) would happen in mid January 2025, before FOSDEM.

Apart from scheduled PRs, we want to focus on two items:

- Having a more-or-less completion of the platform re-architecting track.
- Integrating the testing infrastructure in the GitHub CI pipelines.

I'm making a push to have Simon, Michalis, Sergiu, potentially also Andrei with a healthy amount of time involved in the platform re-architecting track.

## :wrench: TODOs and Decisions

RD: Schedule meeting with Simon and Michalis to get feedback for the [`catalog-core` repository](https://github.com/unikraft/catalog-core).

RD: Work on the release notes.

RD: Ping everyone on release work.
