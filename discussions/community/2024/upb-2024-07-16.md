## Discussions

### MTE

SJ: MTE 3rd patch sent.
No review yet.
I wll send a reminder.

SJ: I expect another deeper review to happen.

RD: Any other updates on the [`catalog`](https://github.com/unikraft/catalog) or [`docs`](https://github.com/unikraft/docs) items?

SJ: No, I plan to resurface them starting from August.

### VMI

AV: No updates since last week.
Same TODO items:
- Clean up work and add VMI fork in [repository](https://github.com/unikraft/lib-vmi)
- Add example and support scripts.

### ARM64 Bincompat

RZ: I opened the PRs related to Unikraft.

RZ: The PCI mapping update from Michalis is in [PR state](https://github.com/unikraft/unikraft/pull/1465).
Once that is reviewed, I could rebase my work and retry testing with the current `staging`.

RD: Did you try with Nginx or a networking app? What is the most complex app you've used?

RZ: I didn'test networking apps, I need to retry them, also considering Michalis's PR.

RZ: About the catalog, how can I use a `Dockerfile` targeted for ARM64 builds.

RD: Check out the [platform / target environment variables used by Docker](https://docs.docker.com/build/building/multi-platform/#cross-compilation).
