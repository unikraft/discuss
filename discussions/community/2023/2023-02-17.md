### Status updates

Andra: Sairaj added some changes on the SMP part, will continue looking for scenarios for testing that.
Other reviews on other PRs.

CC: Mostly worked on kraftkit.
Kraftkit 0.4 is out, no more dependencies on libgit, it's all statically compiled in.

Lukas: No updates, I started using kraftkit but did not encounter any outstanding issues.
Will try and work on using kraftkit with a specific patch on the unikraft core.

Marco: PR for firecracker submitted this week.

AlexJ: Kraftkit 0.4 release, a lot of bug fixes.
On the roadmap, Luca is working on the `kraft info` subcommand.
