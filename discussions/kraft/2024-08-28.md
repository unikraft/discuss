## :closed_book: Discussions

### Xen & KraftKit

AJ: We need to review this.
It's not much work, but we didn't get the time for it.

### Current & Planned Items

AJ: Most updates are related to Kraft Cloud (such as OpenAPI, Go SDK etc.).

### Project Ideas

RD: I'm collecting next steps and ideas inside the community.
These fit two goals:

1. having an aligned view of what we want to do next
1. having items that newcomers or students or contributors can work on

AJ: I have a list of items, I will send them to you.

## :wrench: TODOs and Decisions

RD: Get state of AMI work from Raluca Pelin.

RD: Get back with structured document on tracks / topics.

AJ: Fill topics / tracks on the structure document.
