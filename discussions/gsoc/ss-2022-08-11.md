## :dart: Agenda

- Status update

- Next steps

## :closed_book: Discussions

MS: I've managed to compile and run `SQLite`, `redis` and `nginx` with `gcc-12` on `AArch64`.

MS: I've managed to compile `SQLite`, `redis` and `nginx` with `clang` on `AArch64`.

MS: Only `SQLite` is running normally, I'm still investigating `redis`'s and `nginx`'s behaviour.

MS: I'm unable to run any of these apps with Shadow Stack support.

VB: That's because these apps use multithreading.

VB: Every thread has its own stack, consequently, it should also have its own Shadow Stack, for which, right now, there is no support.

VB: You should consider leaving porting `clang` for complex apps in the background, focus on bringing support for the multithreading friendly Shadow Stack.

VB: Before starting implementing, use `gdb` to investigate a simple program, with 2-3 threads.

## :wrench: TODOs and Decisions

MS: Use `gdb` to investigate a simple program, with 2-3 threads.

MS: Start implementing the Shadow Stack for multithreading programs.

MS: If necessary ask Michalis and Simon about performance issues.

MS: If time allows it, continue to work on porting `clang` for `redis` and `nginx` and testing `app-lua` and `app-python3`.

VB: Further investigate [Android optimizations](https://android-review.googlesource.com/c/kernel/common/+/694163/25/kernel/scs.c)
