## :dart: Agenda

- Status update

- Next steps

## :closed_book: Discussions

MS: I tried building `SQLite` with `clang`.

MS: I get an error regarding a `gcc`-ism (found in `newlib`), which `clang` doesn't seem to understand; I'll switch to `gcc-12`.

MS: However, it seems like installing `gcc-12` for Ubuntu 20.04 is still quite complicated. 

RD: Try to use a container and run your app on your local system (after compiling it there).

RD: You can still try and make the `clang` approach work; it's important to have as many options as possible available for Unikraft users.

MS: I'll follow my roadmap as close as possible.

MS: I tested `lua` for `x86` and I get some errors; I'll further investigate.

RD: The issue regarding `O_NONBLOCK` lays deeper than we thought; we should have a meeting with SK in order to fix it once and for all.


## :wrench: TODOs and Decisions

MS: Fix `newlib` compilation errors for `clang`. 

MS: Use `gcc-12`.

MS: Use Shadow Stack support for complex apps.

MS: Continue to test `lua` and `python3`.

MS: Write blog post.

RD: Talk to SK about the `O_NONBLOCK` issue and it's possible fix.

RD: Check Maria's PR for [`redis`](https://github.com/unikraft/app-redis/pull/6).
