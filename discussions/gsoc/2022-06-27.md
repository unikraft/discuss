### Agenda

Status update

Next steps

### Discussions

MS: Updates
1. Built applications on ARM;
1. Built applications with clang;
1. Built applications with clang and scs outside Unikraft, had to come up with 
a constructor for the shadow stack since clang's `compiler_rt` doesn't provide a
runtime. The `gs register` used for pointing to a location where the scs can be
stored had to be explicitly initialized;
1. Looked into the Android scs implementation; said it was the thoughest part of the assigned tasks;
1. Derived from the Android implementation a possible intern API [1].


VB: Let the Android implementation rest for a bit and focus on a naive approach that'd work for a simple app on Unikraft.

VB: Try and make clang work as a compiler for ARM apps on Unikraft; inject the constructor you've mentioned for the `helloworld` application and see what happens.

### TODOs and Decisions

MS: Use clang and gcc-12 for scs support on Unikraft.

MS: Use a docker approach to compiling with gcc-12

MS: Search for the LLVM implementation of scs.

Razvan, Vlad and Maria to meet next Monday, July 4th, 2022, 3:30pm CEST.
