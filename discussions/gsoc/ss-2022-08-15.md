## :dart: Agenda

- Status update

- Next steps

## :closed_book: Discussions

MS & VB: We'll keep this meeting short, there aren't that many updates.

MS: I've managed to run and compile complex apps using `clang`.

MS: I've come up with an issue regarding core `unikraft` which should be resolved quickly as it is critical.

MS: I plan to finish the Shadow Stack implementation until Thursday this week and start testing it.

MS: For Friday, I'd like to create some patches (for `newlib`) that would address the build errors when using `clang` as a compiler.

MS: I'll need help with that.

## :wrench: TODOs and Decisions

MS: Work on implementing Shadow Stack support for complex apps (multithreading supported scs).

MS: Create patches for `newlib`.

Razvan, Vlad and Maria to meet Thursday, August 18th, 2022, 3:30pm CEST.
